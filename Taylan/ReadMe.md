# Process


- Week 1 Linked Lists:
  - [x] Creating a link list:
      - [x] size() - returns number of data elements in list
      - [x] empty() - bool returns true if empty 
      - [x] front() - get value of front item
      - [x] back() - get value of end item
  - [x] Printing the list:
      - [x] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
      - [x] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
      - [x] Whole list
  - [x] Inserting:
      - [x] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
      - [x] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
      - [x] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
  - [x] Deletion:
      - [x] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
      - [x] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
      - [x] erase(index) - removes node at given index
      - ~~[ ] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value~~
  - [x] Reversing the list:
      - [x] reverse() - reverses the list
      - [x] Printing the reversed list
  - [ ] Merge 2 lists
  - ~~[ ] Doubly-linked List:~~
    - ~~up to the author~~


*Since school works effects my schedule to implement basic data structures and algorithms, I decided to put these works
in this repository.*

- Week 2 `School Work`:
	- [x] DES like crypto algorithm.

*School related works has priority over the rest. But I'll try to catch up my schedule.*

- Week 3 `School Work` + Doubly Linked List:
  - School Work:
    - [ ] ICMP Ping - Ping an IP range and collect IP addresses of the hosts that are alive
    - [ ] Port Identification - Get the IP addresses scan and validate these IP addresses. If an IP address is a valid live host address append it to a string (live hosts) that contains the network of the live hosts
    - [ ] Open Port Identification - Get the IP addresses scan and check and validate these IP addresses. The scanning must find open ports from each host and save the results into a text file.
    - [ ] OS Fingerprint Identification - identify operating systems (OS) and OS versions of the hosts with open ports.
    - [ ] Router & Firewall Detection - Scan and find neighbor router and firewall addresses, protocols, and ports of each router. 
    - [ ] Web Server Detection - Scan and find 10 web-server addresses, protocols, and ports of each web server.
    - [ ] SNMP Detection - Scan and find neighbor hosts addresses having the SNMP-protocols, and ports of each host. 
    - [ ] SYN Flood - will launch SYN-flood attack to a given destination (IP) and port(s). This tool must also enable you to choose the number of flooding.
    - [ ] Sniff - Will sniff a network and display the network traffic on the screen.
  - Dubly Linked List:
    - [ ] Inserting
    - [ ] Printing
    - [ ] Deletion
