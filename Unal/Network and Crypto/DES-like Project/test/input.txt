Read a plaintext from a file block by block with block size of ten characters. Please note that plaintext file must contain more than ten lines of text. The ten character text blocks are passed through the initial permutation. Use Table one to encode characters so that each character will be eight bits of length. Perform a Shift right rotate operation with four positions on the encoded characters. Get two characters at a time from the encoded block. Characters at odd positions are placed into the left nibble and characters with even positions are placed into the right nibble.Each eight bit character from the partitions is XORd with the corresponding key. XORd partitions are now swapped left became right and vice versa. The swapped partitions are XORd with the new sub keys.Partitions are swapped again and merged. Finally a cipher block is obtained by passing the resulting ten character block through the reverse permutation. Encrypted blocks will be saved in a ciphertext file. Finally verify your encryption by decrypting the ciphertext file. Before getting started you may want to find out which IDEs and text editors are tailored to make Python editing easy browse the list of introductory books or look at code samples that you might find helpful. There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the BeginnersGuide Tutorials page. There is also a list of resources in other languages which might be useful if English is not your first language. The online documentation is your first port of call for definitive information. There is a fairly brief tutorial that gives you basic information about the language and gets you started. You can follow this by looking at the library reference for a full description of Pythons many libraries and the language reference for a complete explanation of Pythons syntax. If you are looking for common Python recipes and patterns you can browse the ActiveState Python Cookbook.
